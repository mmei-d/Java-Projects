"AVLTree.java": An AVLTree is a BST (binary search tree) which also maintains the "height balance condition": for every node in the tree, its two child subtrees have heights within one of each other. AVLTree inherits most of its methods from BST.

"ArrayMax.java" uses the IndexMinPQ data structure to return the largest numeric value in an array.
