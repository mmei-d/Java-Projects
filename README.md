"BSTIndex" uses a binary search tree to index and search for actors and movies in a given dataset.

"BlackJack" incorporates the typical rules of black jack into a playable interface.

"MazePathFinder" implements two versions of an algorithm for finding the solution path through a square NxN maze of 0's and 1's, which are the walls. One method uses stacks, while the other uses queues.

"AVLTree.java": An AVLTree is a BST (binary search tree) which also maintains the "height balance condition": for every node in the tree, its two child subtrees have heights within one of each other. AVLTree inherits most of its methods from BST.

"ArrayMax.java" uses the IndexMinPQ data structure to return the largest numeric value in an array.

"DuoDec.java": parseDuoDec() returns the 2's complement binary representation for the DuoDec number given in String s. toString() return the String of DuoDec digit that represent the value of the 2's complement binary number given in the input parameter 'value.'

"NQueens.java" places all N queens on the NxN chessboard so that no queen can attack another queen. This algorithm uses backtracking and stacks.
